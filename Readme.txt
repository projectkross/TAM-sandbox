Original wishlist: 
buttons
links
pages
continuity of visitor
frames
modal?
text boxes
some wacky css
a picture of grimace
separate "site" for a single page app
disappearing and/or hidden elemnts
weird nth children (or elements that can be nested in a way that have nth-children)
card containers where the :contains text is a sibling
custom html elements? like data tags?
dynamic ids
